### Backend errors?
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Look for error messages in the terminal

### Frontend errors?
- Install Node.js dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Clear browser cache and reload

## Manual Setup

If the automated scripts don't work, you can start manually:

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access on Mobile
Open `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3000` on your phone
