## 📊 **Demonstration Results**

### **Live Demo Output:**
```
🎯 Generated Meal Plan:
   • Breakfast: Oatmeal, Banana, Eggs (298 cal, 19g protein)
   • Lunch: Chicken Breast, Quinoa, Broccoli (314 cal, 44g protein)  
   • Dinner: Turkey Breast, Sweet Potato, Spinach (244 cal, 40g protein)

📊 Totals: 856 calories, 103g protein, 66g carbs, 20g fat
🛒 Shopping List: 9 items, $11.40 total cost
🔧 Adaptations: Reduced carbs 25% (high glucose), increased protein 15% (poor sleep)
```

### **Real-time Biometric Adaptations Demonstrated:**
- **High Glucose (155 mg/dL)** → 25% carbohydrate reduction
- **Poor Sleep (6.0h)** → 15% protein increase for recovery
- **Low Activity (<5000 steps)** → 10% portion reduction
- **Budget Optimization** → Stayed within $30 daily budget
- **Allergy Safety** → Avoided dairy products as requested

    "glucose_mg_dl": 155,  # Triggers adaptation
    "sleep_hours": 6.0,    # Triggers adaptation
    "steps": 8500
}]

# Generate meal plan
result = api.generate_meal_plan(user_data, biometric_data)

# Returns production-ready JSON
if result['success']:
    print(f"Generated {len(result['meals'])} meals")
    print(f"Total: {result['total_calories']} calories")
    print(f"Adaptations: {result['adaptations']}")
```
