#### Technical Features
1. **Agent-Based Architecture**:
   - Data Analyzer Agent for biometric/genetic analysis
   - Meal Planner Agent with genetic algorithm optimization
   - Adaptation Agent for real-time meal modifications
   - Coordinator for agent communication and load balancing

2. **Advanced Algorithms**:
   - Differential evolution for meal plan optimization
   - Rule-based adaptation system with cooldown periods
   - Health trend analysis and risk assessment models

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Real-time API connections with intelligent caching
   - Comprehensive food filtering (dietary types, allergens, nutrition)
   - Genetic profile analysis for personalized nutrition
